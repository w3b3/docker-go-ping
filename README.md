# docker-go-ping

A simple Go server/microservice example for [Docker's Go Language Guide](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/).

Notable features:

* Includes a [multi-stage `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping/blob/main/Dockerfile.multistage), which actually is a good example of how to build Go binaries _for production releases_.
* Has functional tests for application's business requirements with proper isolation between tests using [`ory/dockertest`](https://github.com/ory/dockertest).
* Has a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run functional tests in independent containers.
* Has a CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to publish to Docker Hub.

Planned:

* Building Go modules and Docker images with `goreleaser`
